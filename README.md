# AdrianInfo

this quirky and interesting mod is made for my friend and renames most items in the game and changes descriptions (no language replacements necessary!). It has only been tested client side but shouldn't cause you any issues if you run it online, maybe, I hope. Replaced item names and descriptions reference CoD, Pokemon, and whatever else was on Adrian's mind when I asked him what he wanted this mod to do.
