# Kanna's Quality of Life

My friend gave me a list of things to improve the flow of gameplay. So I did.

## Things this mod adds

* Instant Scrapping and Printing
* Scrapper(s) in Bazaar (up to however many players there are)
* Ping Lunar Seers to see destination
* Teleporter instantly finishes charging after boss is killed, with time adjusted
* Guaranteed Cleansing Pool on Alphesian Sanctuary
* Only pet the glass frog once for deep void portal (cost configurable!)

## TODO

* Testing (hahaha.. good one)
* Add Pinging Red Chests / Newt Altars on stage start

### Special Thanks
* prod (Making config files work)
* Kanna
* Kevin (Scrapper in shop implementation)
* mrchous & Arbition (formulas for tele charge skip)
